# vCSA Certificate Replacement Procedures

## What this project is for

This sub-folder in the [Straypenguin's Tips Inventory](https://github.com/Tatsuya-Nonogaki/Straypenguins-Tips-Inventory) provides practical, field-tested guidance for managing and renewing certificates in VMware vSphere environments (vCSA/PSC).

It is specifically focused on scenarios where you use Broadcom/VMware‚Äôs supported tools‚Äî**vCert.py** and **fixcerts.py**‚Äîto keep your platform secure and operational.  
The procedures and reference materials here are intended to assist system engineers and administrators in planning, executing, and troubleshooting certificate replacement tasks in real-world environments.

> **Note:** This project currently focuses on VMCA-signed certificates, not custom CA-signed deployments.

VMware (Broadcom) provides several tools to maintain certificates on vCSA:

- **[vCert](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/385107)** ‚Äì The recommended, interactive certificate management tool (`vCert.py`), supporting comprehensive renewal operations, validation, and trust anchor management.
- **[fixcerts.py](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=90561)** ‚Äì A legacy but still usable CLI utility for targeted certificate replacement, officially deprecated but still referenced for certain advanced cases.
- **certificate-manager** ‚Äì The built-in vCSA utility for basic certificate operations.

This project organizes and streamlines procedures for renewing the various certificate types, including best practices for backup, verification, and troubleshooting.

Unlike typical ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù guides, these procedures are built with resilience and flexibility in mind:  
Whenever a tool encounters an error or limitation, the documentation offers clear failover steps‚Äîswitching to alternative tools, diagnosing with logs, or rolling back safely.  
This makes it especially valuable for system engineers and administrators operating in real production environments, where flexibility and troubleshooting are essential.
