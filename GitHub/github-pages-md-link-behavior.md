# GitHub Pages + Jekyll: How Markdown Links Are Handled (2025 Edition)

## Overview

When building documentation with GitHub Pages (*Pages*) and Jekyll, many writers wonder:
- How should I write internal links between `.md` files?
- Will links break when converting Markdown to HTML?
- Do I need to maintain both `.md` and `.html` links?

**GitHub Pages** (with its default Jekyll setup) provides powerful, automatic handling of Markdown links‚Äîthanks to built-in plugins like `jekyll-relative-links`. This article summarizes observed behaviors and explains how it all works, so you can write Markdown links with confidence.

üìù **Note:**  
The behavior described in this document is based on my experiments and observations in Sep 2025. They may vary in the future.

### Link Related Basic Behavior on GitHub Web and GitHub Pages + Jekyll

#### üìå index.md VS README.md

- GitHub Web view recognizes `README.md` as the primary index, not `index.md`.
- In GitHub Pages (*Pages*) view, `index.html` is recognized as the primary index; this is not really a *Pages*'s behavior, the serving standard of an *HTML Server*, which *Pages* follows. 
- *Pages* tries to convert both `index.md` and `README.md` into `index.html`. This logically collides, of cource. It seems the page generation algorithm always find `index.md` first to be converted, thus `README.md` is not touched.

  üìù **Additional Note:**  
  When `index.md` is created in addtion to an already existing `README.md`, `index.md` is converted into html to overwrite `index.html`. When `index.md` is removed and `README.md` remains, the new `index.html` is created from it. I think some different results were observed; it might suggest existence of some race condition.

#### üìå My `_config.yml`

```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-sitemap
```

My `_config.yml` is this simple. See [Best Practices & Practical Tips](#4-best-practices--practical-tips).

## 1. Three Key Link Conversion Behaviors

### (1) Relative Link to a Directory Containing a README.md

- **Link in .md:** `Linux/OpenSSL/`
- **HTML Generation:** The link is left as-is (`Linux/OpenSSL/`).
- **HTML Browsing:** Navigating to `/Linux/OpenSSL/` displays the rendered `index.html`.

### (2) Relative Link Directly to a README.md

- **Link in .md:** `vSphere/vcsa-cert-replace-procedures/README.md`
- **HTML Generation:** The link is automatically rewritten to the directory path (`/Straypenguins-Tips-Inventory/vSphere/vcsa-cert-replace-procedures/`), with no filename or extension.
- **HTML Browsing:** The directory‚Äôs `index.html` is displayed.

### (3) Relative Link to a Non-README/index Markdown File

- **Link in .md:** `vcsa-cert-replace-procedures.md`
- **HTML Generation:** The link is rewritten to an absolute path ending in `.html`, such as `/Straypenguins-Tips-Inventory/vSphere/vcsa-cert-replace-procedures/vcsa-cert-replace-procedures.html`.
- **HTML Browsing:** The linked file is available as an `.html` page.

## 2. The Mechanism: `jekyll-relative-links` Plugin

GitHub Pages enables several Jekyll plugins by default (see [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)), including:

- `jekyll-relative-links`
- `jekyll-readme-index`
- and others

**jekyll-relative-links** is key:  
It automatically rewrites Markdown links between `.md` files so that, when your site is built, links point to the corresponding `.html` files (or directory paths for `index.html`). This means you can write all your internal links simply as `[Label](other-page.md)` or `[Label](Subfolder/)`, and they‚Äôll Just Work‚Ñ¢ in the published site.

## 4. Best Practices & Practical Tips

- **Write links as `.md` or directory references** in your Markdown files.  
  No need to hand-convert to `.html` for the site!
- **README.md** or **index.md** become `index.html` for its folder, accessible via the directory path.
- From the current implementation on GitHub side, it seems having only `README.md` is the best practice.
- If you want to offer both GitHub Web view (`.md`) and GitHub Pages view (`.html`) to readers,  
  consider dual-linking‚Äîbut for most use cases, a single `.md` link suffices.
- No need to manually add `jekyll-relative-links` or other plugins in `_config.yml`‚Äîthey‚Äôre enabled by default on GitHub Pages.
- Avoid over-customizing `_config.yml` unless you have a specific requirement.

## 5. Summary

- **Modern GitHub Pages + Jekyll** handles Markdown links automatically and smartly.
- You can write clean, maintainable documentation without worrying about link breakage, except for any particularly complex situation.
- Old advice about manually adjusting links or adding extra plugins is now outdated.
